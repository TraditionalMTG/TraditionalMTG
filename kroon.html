                <p>
                    Jab at ourselves for being late to organize stuff.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In response to Unnamed #4 being a bit late on organization, Estonian Kroon was announced 4 days
                    before the start, leaving a lot of time for participants to decide if they will be able to play
                    and what will they be playing. Sadly, even with a week of preparation, some were still late with
                    deck submissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Estonian Kroon did not try anything new. People did not like open decklists that was done during
                    the Unnamed #4 and we did not reveal them until way after the thing. 12 People registered to
                    participate, but only 11 showed up. Regardless, we consider this tournament a success.
                </p>

                <h2>The result</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike the Unnamed #4, Estonian Kroon was more control heavy. We're pretty happy that metagame
                    shifts accordingly to what is being played. Sadly, the most memed archetype, bogles, was not
                    played. All in all, players still had some relative fun...
                </p>
                <p>We hope to make further improvements while doing tournaments. And now for the result:</p>

                    The tournament went smoothly, sadly 1 person was a no show.

                    The tournament was taken by the Grull midrange deck, by Pinecone, with a 4-0 run. It's a more
                    aggresive variant of jund midrange that runs utopia sprawl.

                    The runner ups, sharing second and third places were Jeskai Control decks. The most fun decks in
                    the tournament.

                <p>
                    All in all, players had chosen to play more control decks during this tournament. We hope that
                    games were still entertaining if 1 person had not shown up.
