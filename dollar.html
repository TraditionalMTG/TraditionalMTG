        <h1>Tournament #3 - American Dollar</h1>
        <main>
            <p>
                Nothing much has happened since the last time. Tournament times aren't changing.
                But we are adding additional requirements to submitting your decks, as seen down below.
                There weren't any debates about rule changes, besides running our own banlist, since
                VIETNAMESE DONG. That's a big no no for now, but nothing is absolute. Regardless, I must
                announce TRADITIONAL TOURNAMENT #3, codename AMERICAN DOLLAR.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is another call to brew tournament, but this time, tournaments theme is to port T1 decks
                of modern into traditional format. The more archetypes, the better. After all, USA is THE BEST
                country in entire world.
            </p>

            Rules:
            <pre style="background-color: lightgrey">1. Same as traditional format rules as provided in github page.</pre>

            <p>
                Date: 05-09
                <br>
                Time: UTC 19:00
                <br>
                Format: Swiss
                <br>
                Deck submission deadline: 1 hour before the start.
                <br>
                <span class="bold underline">This time we won't be waiting for last minute participants.</span>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                This time we will be using
                <a href="https://challonge.com/ua1dp3n">Challonge</a>
                for tournament match
                scheduling rather than tools provided by platform. That way, we won't have to remake the tournament
                (if its on xmage), when someone drops before the start. In addition, this tournament is not limited to
                xmage, if for what ever reason you cannot play on it. We will be using regular FNM scoring system, which
                is 3 points for win, 1 points for tie. Don't worry, you won't need to register anywhere in addition. To
                join the tournament, we'll require you to join the discord, even with a throwaway account.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, I would prefer if you provided decklist in a more exportable format (examples include
                but are not limited to deckstats, tappedout, mtggoldfish, dck file from xmage/mtgo/cockatrice), not
                an image. That way, we could start doing meta analysis via automation tools and provide charts for
                people interested in how our metagame differs from regular modern.
