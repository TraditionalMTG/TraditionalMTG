        <h1>Tournament #3 - American Dollar</h1>
        <main>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Nothing much has happened since the last time. Tournament times aren't changing.
                    But we are adding additional requirements to submitting your decks, as seen down below.
                    There weren't any debates about rule changes, besides running our own banlist, since
                    VIETNAMESE DONG. That's a big no no for now, but nothing is absolute. Regardless, I must
                    announce TRADITIONAL TOURNAMENT #3, codename AMERICAN DOLLAR.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is another call to brew tournament, but this time, tournaments theme is to port T1 decks
                    of modern into traditional format. The more archetypes, the better. After all, USA is THE BEST
                    country in entire world.
                </p>

                Rules:
                <pre style="background-color: lightgrey">1. Same as traditional format rules as provided in github page.</pre>

                <p>
                    Date: 05-09
                    <br>
                    Time: UTC 19:00
                    <br>
                    Format: Swiss
                    <br>
                    Deck submission deadline: 1 hour before the start.
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold underline">This time we won't be waiting for last minute participants.</span>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This time we will be using
                    <a href="https://challonge.com/ua1dp3n">Challonge</a>
                    for tournament match
                    scheduling rather than tools provided by platform. That way, we won't have to remake the tournament
                    (if its on xmage), when someone drops before the start. In addition, this tournament is not limited to
                    xmage, if for what ever reason you cannot play on it. We will be using regular FNM scoring system, which
                    is 3 points for win, 1 points for tie. Don't worry, you won't need to register anywhere in addition. To
                    join the tournament, we'll require you to join the discord, even with a throwaway account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, I would prefer if you provided decklist in a more exportable format (examples include
                    but are not limited to deckstats, tappedout, mtggoldfish, dck file from xmage/mtgo/cockatrice), not
                    an image. That way, we could start doing meta analysis via automation tools and provide charts for
                    people interested in how our metagame differs from regular modern.
                </p>

                <h2>The result</h2>
                <p>
                    The tournament itself was a smoother experience because we self hosted the matches, rather than
                    depended on xmage's tournament system. We have also learned a couple of things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can drop people without ruining the challonge tournament.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is possible to go 4-0 in this format.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We hope to make further improvements while doing tournaments. And now for the result:
                </p>

                <p>
                    (insert table here)
                </p>

                <p>
                    The tournament was a smashing success. 11 people wanted to play but one of them had dropped before,
                    leaving us with an even 10 player count. Sadly during the tournament Hyperhaxorus had to drop due
                    to network issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tournament was taken by AMERICAN SPIRITS deck, by cmpxchg mommy, with a glorious 4-0 run. It's a
                    spirits tribal deck that played around removal by flashing in spirits that give other spirits
                    hexproof. Given how targetted removal is still strong in Traditional, as it is in Modern, it is
                    pretty annoying to deal with, unless you are running tribal hate cards such as plague engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The runner up was Merfolk Tribal deck, by Eltharyon, at 3-1. Being a monoblue deck it is more than
                    capable of running control shenanigans to secure his way to the face. An interesting tech was to
                    run Spreading Seas. A two mana enchantment that effectively removes a land by turning it into an
                    island.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third place got handed to Expensive Prison deck, by Dragas at 2-2 (which coincidentally tied
                    everyone between 3rd and 7th places). It's a mono white deck that is build around preventing your
                    opponent from playing non-creature spells, activating abilities and attacking in general. In real
                    life, this deck isn't that hard to deal with, but on xmage, it's pretty cumbersome, since the
                    interface asks you to pay for each creature independently. He should stop playing that deck.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All in all, each deck was unique and promoted fair and interactive gameplay. We hope to provide
                    better means to organize tournaments and have more fun in the future.
