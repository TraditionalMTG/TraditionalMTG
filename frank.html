                    With the Eternal Witness bot working basically as intended, the tournament returned to the usual naming scheme – currency that’s tangentially related to the last tournament. The tournament was held at the same time like the last one – one hour earlier than usual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The small number of players – 8 registered and 6 played - could be attributed to the summer finally arriving, lockdowns slightly loosening in some countries or, most likely, people defending their private property from rioters. Also, one person slept through.

                <h2>The result</h2>
                <p>
                    While the format’s favorite meme archetype – Bogles – finally proved its power last tournament, this time the deck cemented itself as a powerhouse. Players spent several sideboard slots specifically against bogles, but it didn’t stop the hexproof menaces from taking the tournament. The rest of the field was much more control heavy than the last time – further showing that the format tends to swing from control to aggro every tournament in a pendulum-style fashion. The tournament itself was shorter thanks to the lower number of players, but we feel like the quality of matches didn't suffer because of it.
                </p>
                <p>We hope to make further improvements while doing tournaments. And now for the result:</p>

                    The tournament was once again taken by the Bogles deck, by Zetgietto, with a 3-0 run.

                <p>
                    Everyone's favorite underdog, Rusty's UB Mill, took second place, sharing it with cmpxchg's UW Miracles, both at 2-1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both old favorites and powerful new strategies were seen in this diminutive tournament, showing off a healthy metagame.

                <p>
                    All in all, a control-heavier tournament was once again taken by Bogles, proving they are without a doubt, the deck to beat.
