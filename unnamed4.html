                    Poor communication was had while trying to hide the mystery project in works that is supposed to
                    automate tournament management, deck validation and creation. But at the very last minute, one of
                    the moderators stepped in and organized a tournament on XMage platform, saving the format from evil
                    forces for another week. No particular theme was had, but all in all, people still managed to
                    scribble up new and unique decks further pushing what you can do in this format.
                </p>

                Rules:
                <pre style="background-color: #fcfcfc">1. Same as traditional format rules as provided in github page.
2. Decklists are revealed shortly after deck submission deadline.</pre>

                        There was one last minute participant to prevent byes. Some people never showed up,
                        causing some people to still get byes.

                    Tournament was hastily organized using XMage. Decklists were revealed as a test to see if decision
                    making during matches would be impacted if you were playing as if it was your regular LGS
                    tournament.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All decklists were submitted via tapped out or mtggoldfish. Thank you for your cooperation.

                <h2>The result</h2>
                <p>
                    Sadly, due to lack of experience with challonge, the tournament was done using xmage. This caused
                    some issues because 3 people never showed up. In addition, before the start, one person was
                    admitted after decklists were revealed, but instead of being permitted to build a deck, he was
                    given a UG merfolk deck. This tournament did reveal several things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We should not organize tournaments hastily.</li>
                    <li>Open decklists had a mixed reception.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> We hope to make further improvements while doing tournaments. And now for the result:</p>

                    The tournament went smoothly, sadly 3 people were no shows. On the other hand, we had 2 new
                    people around this time.

                    The tournament was taken by the Boros burn deck, by cmpxchg mommy, with a 4-0 run. It's a generic
                    burn deck that splashed white for some removal that red lacks so much.

                    The runner up was a Mono red blitz deck, by Friend, at 3-1. It's another red burn variant,
                    which instead of splashing white, ran manamorphosis for that card draw and additional prowess
                    triggers.

                    The third place got handed to UG Merfolk deck, by newcomer Baby Snake at 3-1, tied with Friend.
                    Being the very last minute participant he was given this deck by Jyro, so that he wouldn't get a
                    deckbuilding advantage due to decklists being revealed.

                <p>
                    All in all, players had chosen to play more aggressive decks during this tournament. We hope that
                    games were still entertaining if 3 people had not shown up.
