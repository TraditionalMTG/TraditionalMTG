            Rejoice! Eternal Witness now supports hosting tournaments with more formats than Traditional, entering us
            into a true brewing event gold age. What does this mean to regular players and events? Frankly, nothing
            much. The deck submission flow is the same. Deadline bug is still present. But this time, you will be
            allowed to submit a legacy
            deck, provided that an event is hosted with hosted with legacy deckbuilding rules. In addition, this permits
            us to experiment with unbans without fucking up ongoing events.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the first brewing event of its kind. Hence a bit different rules and increased deadline by 2 hours.
            In addition, this event moves traditional to be more like penny dreadful - a deckbuilding ruleset modifier,
            rather than strictly based on modern.
        </p>


        Rules:
        <pre>
1. Base cardpool is modern.
2. Same rules as on traditionalmtg.github.io.
3. Banned cards: Veil of Summer.
4. Unbanned cards: Tree of Tales, Seat of the Synod, Great Furnace,
Ancient Den, Vault of Whispers, and Mycosynth Lattice.
5. If eternal witness permits playing the deck, you can play it.
